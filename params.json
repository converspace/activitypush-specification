Alice's website aggregates posts from eveyone she follows (via [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)).\r\n2. Alice visits her website, notices a post by Bob (that he made on his website) and _likes_ it (on her website).\r\n3. Alice's website notifies Bob's website about the (_like_) activity (using Activity Pingback).\r\n4. Bob's website shows the activity on Bob's activity stream and with his original post.\r\n5. Other users following Bob's website are notified about the activity (via [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)).\r\n\r\n## Protocol Flow\r\n\r\n### Sender discovers Receiver Endpoint\r\n\r\n```\r\n> GET /bob/post/2 HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: bobs.host\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Link: <http://bobs.host/activity-pingback-endpoint>; rel=\"http://activitypingback.org/\"\r\n< ...\r\n<\r\n< <html>\r\n< ...\r\n< <link href=\"http://bobs.host/activity-pingback-endpoint\" rel=\"http://activitypingback.org/\" />\r\n< ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sender Notifies Receiver\r\n\r\n```\r\n> POST /activity-pingback-endpoint HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: bobs.host\r\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-url-form-encoded\r\n>\r\n> actor=http://alices.host/alice&\\\r\n> activityid=http://alices.host/alice/activity/42&\\\r\n> object=http://bobs.host/bob/post/2\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: the \"\\\" character is used here to indicate line wrapping in the request content and is not part of the content itself._\r\n\r\n`bobs.host` should check that the `object` of the `activity` belongs to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Receiver discovers Actor Endpoint\r\n\r\n```\r\n> GET /alice HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: alices.host\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Link: <http://alices.host/activity-pingback-endpoint>; rel=\"http://activitypingback.org/\"\r\n< ...\r\n<\r\n< <html>\r\n< ...\r\n< <link href=\"http://alices.host/activity-pingback-endpoint\" rel=\"http://activitypingback.org/\" />\r\n< ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Receiver gets Activity from Actor Endpoint & Validates it\r\n\r\n```\r\n> GET /activity-pingback-endpoint?actor=...&activityid=...&object=... HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: alices.host\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Content-Type: application/stream+json\r\n<\r\n< {JSON Activity Streams}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bobs.host` should check that the `actor` and the `object` of the `activity` are the same as the one it received in the notification.\r\n\r\nActivity Pingback is agnostic to how Activities are represented as long as it has an `actor` URL, a `verb` and an `object` URL. For example, instead of the `application/stream+json`, 'alices.host` could have returned an HTML representation containing activity [microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/activity-streams) or RDFa.\r\n\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\n* [Pingback](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback)\r\n* [Trackback](http://archive.cweiske.de/trackback/trackback-1.2.html)\r\n* [RESTful Pingback](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Pingback)\r\n* [Semantic Pingback](http://aksw.org/projects/semanticpingback)\r\n* [Salmon Protocol](http://salmon-protocol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-panzer-salmon-00.html)\r\n* [Dialback Authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-prodromou-dialback-00)\r\n* [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)\r\n* [Watch, trust, friend](http://markpasc.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/watch-trust-friend.html)\r\n* [Private webhooks, hold the crypto?](http://markpasc.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/private-webhooks-hold-the-crypto.html)\r\n\r\n## Let's collaborate\r\nFeel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/converspace/activity-pingback/issues) if you have feedback/questions/suggestions."}
