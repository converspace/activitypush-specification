Activites are represented using [Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Discover\r\n\r\n```\r\n> GET /referenced-resource HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: pingback.receiver\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Link: <http://pingback.receiver/activity-pingback-endpoint>; rel=\"http://activitypingback.org/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Notify\r\n\r\n```\r\n> POST /activity-pingback-endpoint HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: pingback.receiver\r\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-url-form-encoded\r\n>\r\n> source=http://pingback.sender/activity/42&\\\r\n> target=http://pingback.receiver/referenced-resource\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: the \"\\\" character is used here to indicate line wrapping in the request content and is not part of the content itself._\r\n\r\nEach `activity` should have a unique URI (`source`). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Get & Validate Activity\r\n\r\n```\r\n> GET /activity/42 HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: pingback.sender\r\n\r\n\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Content-Type: application/json\r\n<\r\n< {JSON Activity Streams}\r\n```\r\n`pingback.receiver` needs to figure out the `activity` based on the `content-type` (if it's a HTML page look for Activity Streams microformat, if it's a JSON Activity Stream just read it). Once it has the `activity`, `pingback.receiver` should check that the `object` in the `activity` is valid. `pingback.receiver` should treat `source` idempotently.\r\n\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\n* [Pingback](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback)\r\n* [Trackback](http://archive.cweiske.de/trackback/trackback-1.2.html)\r\n* [RESTful Pingback](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Pingback)\r\n* [Semantic Pingback](http://aksw.org/projects/semanticpingback)\r\n* [Salmon Protocol](http://salmon-protocol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-panzer-salmon-00.html)\r\n* [Dialback Authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-prodromou-dialback-00)\r\n* [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)\r\n* [Watch, trust, friend](http://markpasc.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/watch-trust-friend.html)\r\n* [Private webhooks, hold the crypto?](http://markpasc.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/private-webhooks-hold-the-crypto.html)\r\n\r\n## Let's collaborate\r\nFeel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/converspace/activity-pingback/issues) if you have feedback/questions/suggestions."}
